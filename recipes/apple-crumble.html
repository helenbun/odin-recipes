        <h1>Apple Crumble</h1>
        <img src="../img/apple-crumble.jpg" alt="An apple crumble in a white dish with portions served in two bowls">
        <p>A bagful of apples from my brother's garden brings with it the promise of cosy comfort food. And one of my favourite recipes is this wonderful vegan apple crumble 
            from <a href="https://cnz.to/recipes/desserts/butterless-apple-crumble-recipe/">Chocolate and Zucchini</a>. It's always a winner in my house, served with a dollop 
            of vegan ice cream or homemade vanilla custard. Bring on autumn!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>100 grams (3.5 ounces, about 3/4 cup) flour</li>
            <li>100 grams (1 cup) rolled grains of your choice (oat, spelt, wheat, rye, quinoa, rice, barley... or a mix thereof)</li>
            <li>100 grams (1/2 cup) sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>80 ml (1/3 cup) oil</li>
            <li>1.5 kilos organic apples (3 1/3 pounds, about 8 medium)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the crumble topping up to a day in advance: in a medium mixing bowl, combine all the ingredients from flour to oil, and stir well with a fork to combine, 
                making sure all of the dry ingredients are moistened by the oil. If making in advance, transfer to an airtight container and keep in the fridge.</li>
            <li>On the day of serving, preheat the oven to 180°C (360°F). Peel the apples in alternating vertical stripes so that you retain some, but not all of the peel. 
                Quarter and core the apples, then cut into smallish chunks.</li>
            <li>Arrange the apple chunks over the bottom of a baking dish (the one I generally use is a 25-cm or 10" square) and sprinkle evenly with the topping.</li>
            <li>Insert in the oven and bake for about 40 minutes, until the apples are tender and the topping golden brown, checking regularly to make sure it doesn't darken 
                too much (if it does, cover loosely with a piece of parchment paper).</li>
            <li>Serve slightly warm or at room temperature. You can bake the crumble a few hours in advance, and reheat slightly before serving: if the oven was in use for 
                the main course, I'll just put the crumble in the cooling oven while we eat. The leftovers are fantastic straight out of the fridge the next day.</li>
        </ol>
