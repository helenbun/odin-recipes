    <p>This is such an easy and satisfying recipe. I love recipes from <a href="https://minimalistbaker.com/easy-1-pot-marinara-sauce/">Minimalist Baker</a>. Their recipes
    use a small number of ingredients and are simple to make but always taste amazing!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Tbsp olive oil (sub water if avoiding oil)</li>
        <li>2 large cloves garlic (minced)</li>
        <li>2 28-ounce cans peeled crushed or diced tomatoes without salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried or fresh oregano</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp sugar </li>
        <li>3/4 – 1 tsp sea salt</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp red pepper flake</li>
        <li>1/2 cup roughly chopped fresh basil (plus more for serving)</li>
        <li>1-3 Tbsp nutritional yeast</li>
        <li>3-4 Tbsp tomato paste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large pot over medium-low heat. Once hot, add oil and garlic. Sauté briefly for 1 minute, stirring frequently, until barely golden brown. 
            Then add tomatoes, oregano, coconut sugar, salt, and pepper flake.</li>
        <li>Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Then reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Then add basil and stir. 
            Cook for 5 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more salt for saltiness, oregano or basil for freshness/herbed flavor, pepper flake for heat, or coconut 
            sugar for sweetness. At this time, you can also choose to add nutritional yeast and/or tomato paste for more depth of flavor and richness (optional, 
            but I usually add both).</li>
        <li>If the sauce has thickened too much at this point, thin with a little water. Although I prefer mine thicker and leave it on the thick/chunky side.</li>
    </ol>
